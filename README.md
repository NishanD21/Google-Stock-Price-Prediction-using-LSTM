## ðŸ“ˆ Google Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting Google (Alphabet Inc.) stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks â€” a powerful deep learning technique for time series forecasting.
The project covers the complete workflow of time series analysis, including:

Data collection and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature scaling and sequence preparation
Building and training the LSTM model
Model evaluation and visualization of predictions

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack:

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ”§ Goal:
To build a predictive model that can forecast future Google stock prices based on historical data, demonstrating the application of LSTM networks in financial time series forecasting.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements:

Hyperparameter tuning
Adding external features (e.g., market indicators, news sentiment)
Comparison with other models like ARIMA, Prophet, or GRU
